This project displays in three steps how to use the Codable-protocol with inheritance.

We use two different classes

- ParentClass
- ChildClass

in three different groups

Model-Step-1 : Only a minimal implementation for init:from Decoder in ChildClass realized
Model-Step-2 : This adds full implementations of init:from and encode:to in ParentClass
Model-OK : Here wie ad a full implementation of init:from and encode:to in ChildClass

To switch between these implementations check the target membership of the model to use. Every other model files need to be unchecked

Two Testclasses are implemented

- ParentClassTests
- ChildClassTests

What are the test result?

The Implementations of Step1 or Step2 both create errors.
Model-Step-1 creates a runtime Error. And this runtime error is not neccessarily marked at the right place in code!
Model-Step-2 does not load the Child-Class-Attribute

So to use the Codable-Protocol with inheritance you need to implement init:from and encode:to for the whole inheritance tree.
