############################
Basics
############################

We introduce the usage of Codable with
structs -> BasicStruct.swift
classes -> BasicClass.swift
enum -> BAsicEnum.swift

structs and classes are straightforward. In case that attributes are Codable it is only neccessary to declared the
struct or class Codable.

In case of an enum the encoder and decoder routines need to be implemented.

############################
Complex
############################

The Complex-Example displays, that if your own classes implements Codable, a Class or struct with attributes of your Codable classes, structs or enum still only needs to declare the Codable protocol. Everything else works behind the scene.

############################
JSON
############################

This Example show, how to write and read JSON (Testcase JSONTests) and how to rename the codingkeys (CustomizedStruct.swift)

Hint : If you got a typo in your codingkeys, the compiler asks you to implement encode and decode for your class, struct or enum. Check the correct writing of your keys. The need to bee the same as your attribute names.

############################
Optionals
############################

We lern how to load and save Optionals
BasicClassWithNilValue shows the use oautomatic coding and decoding. Everything is ok
CustomClassWIthNilValueWrong has two errors. It reads and writes nil-Values with encode and decode. This leads to exceptions
CustomClassWithNilValueOK uses encodeIfPresent and decodeIfPresent on optionals. THis is the correct way for custom encode and decode of optionals.


############################
Inheritance
############################

This group displays in three steps how to use the Codable-protocol with inheritance.

We use two different classes

- ParentClass
- ChildClass

in three different groups

Model-Step-1 : Only a minimal implementation for init:from Decoder in ChildClass realized
Model-Step-2 : This adds full implementations of init:from and encode:to in ParentClass
Model-OK : Here wie ad a full implementation of init:from and encode:to in ChildClass

To switch between these implementations check the target membership of the model to use. Every other model files need to be unchecked

Two Testclasses are implemented

- ParentClassTests
- ChildClassTests

What are the test result?

The Implementations of Step1 or Step2 both create errors.
Model-Step-1 creates a runtime Error. And this runtime error is not neccessarily marked at the right place in code!
Model-Step-2 does not load the Child-Class-Attribute

So to use the Codable-Protocol with inheritance you need to implement init:from and encode:to for the whole inheritance tree.


##################################
InheritanceAndCollections
##################################
This group displays how to correctly store and load heterogenious collections with the Codable protocol.
The key is to write first while writing an object which kind of class is written.
When reading back the data we first read, which kind of object follows and then call the correct reader.
